PWAN is an acronym for Property World Africa Network. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She leads a team of 17 Managing Directors with 110 direct Staff spread across 17 Affiliate Companies that make up the PWAN Group and over 30 thousand Independent Real Estate Professionals generally called Consultants. At a time when Nigeria\u2019s employment market was dwindling and some families losing their homes due to lack of funds to pay rent, Jayne and her darling husband Augustine Onwumere received a God given vision to make home ownership dream a reality for as many people as possible. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This dream birthed a Real Estate Network Marketing Company in March 2012 with the Pioneer Company known as PWAN Homes. PWAN HOMES is acronym for Property World Africa Network Home Ownership Made Easy Scheme. PWAN pioneered the first Real Estate Network Marketing Business in Nigeria, Africa and in the World (to the best of our knowledge) providing opportunities for hundreds of thousands of Nigerians to earn consistent Income as Real Estate Entrepreneurs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the history of Nigeria, we have not experienced more people in Real Estate than we have now and it is all due to this novel idea birthed by this Couple even at a time when they were homeless. With focus, determination and hardwork, The PWAN Team today (comprising of Staffs, Partners and Consultants) are engaging with both public and private sectors, Individuals and Nigerians in the diaspora to bring massive change in the life of people. This has strengthened synergies and yielded positive outcomes for the sector. In 2017, Mama Africa as she is fondly called single handedly empowered 50 women to start up small business venture or to improve existing ones with Fifty Thousand Naira each through her Empowerment for all Women Program. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This she intends to do every year for as long as the Lord enables her to do so. She has organized several outreaches to Orphanages with a lot of provisions and monetary gifts. Together with her husband, she pays school fees for so many children, pays house rent for many and keeps a Completely Open-Door policy that has made many refer to her as Mummy, Mama Africa etc. The work done by PWAN in just a little over Six (6) years has inspired so many people to venture not just into real estate business by using the PWAN Model but into other businesses. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People now understand you do not necessarily need money to venture, you need faith, you need focus and you need tenacity. And mostly, you need to have love for people and a desire to empower people to become the best they can be. Jayne Obioma Onwumere, a Lifelong Learner, is an Alumni of Lagos Business School. She is married to her Best Friend, a man she believes God used to birth relevance in her life and they are blessed with three lovely children.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"modal-style-995-1003\" class=\"awsm-modal-item awsm-scale-anm awsm-modal-hidden awsm-all \" data-info=\"1003\">\n\t<div id=\"awsm-member-info-995-1003\" class=\"awsm-modal-content\">\n\t\t<div class=\"awsm-modal-content-main\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"awsm-image-main\">\n\t\t\t\t<img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/pwanlekki.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/director3.jpg\" class=\"attachment-awsm_team size-awsm_team wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" \/>\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"awsm-modal-details\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"awsm-modal-content-inner\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3>MANAGING DIRECTOR<\/h3><h2>Mrs Obianuju Chinemerem Chinwuba<\/h2>\n<p>Obianuju Chinemerem Chinwuba is best described as an Entrepreneur par excellence who has been very active in people empowerment.
